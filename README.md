# Data-Mining Example of calculate class probabilities of two different class i.e 1= True and 0=False
Include Math library which has required for calculation of  probabilities.
Develop various functions  such as 
  a)Split the dataset by class values,it returns a dictionar.
  b)Calculate the mean of a list of numbers
  c)Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers
  d)Split dataset by class then calculate statistics for each row
  e)Calculate the Gaussian probability distribution function for x
  f)Calculate the probabilities of predicting each class for a given row
Test calculating class probabilities
Finally print the Result.
