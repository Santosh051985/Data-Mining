Following Steps are perform while development of Principal Component Analysis Algorithm.
1. Importing required libraries
2.Store the dataset on variable with help of read function 
3.Divide  the dataset into the Training set and Test set with ratio of 80 % and 20%
4. Perform the Feature Scaling
5. Applying the PCA function into training and testing set for analysis.
6. Fitting Logistic Regression To the training set
7. Predicting the test set result
8. Making the confusion matrix
9.Predicting the training set result
10. Visualising the Test set results
